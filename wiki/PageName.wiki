#Tank war - A game in turtle module of python

Add your content here.

This game is designed using turtle module in python 2.6.6 . It was designed as a part of mc121 (a course in python at iiser -k ) project in the session 2010-11.

The turtle demo suite for Python 2.5/2.6 contains a backport of version 1.1 of the turtle module, which ships with python 3.1 to python 2.5 and python 2.6. If you use one of these versions, I recommend to replace the turtle module present in your version by the one delivered with this bundle.

If you like to modify the game or add a new game built in turtle module, please ask me for including you as a com-miter of the project.

please visit http://code.google.com/p/python-turtle-demo/ for turtle demo. This page has helped me a lot in making the game.
